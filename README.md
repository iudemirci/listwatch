# listwatch

**ListWatch** is a full-featured movie and TV show discovery platform that I built from scratch using **React** and **Supabase**. Inspired by platforms like [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/), it combines a clean UI with useful features such as **liking content**, **building custom lists**, and **leaving reviews**. The project started as my first large-scale web app, and it became an opportunity for me to bring together everything I‚Äôve learned about **frontend development**, **backend integration**, and **user experience design**. The website is designed to be **responsive**, providing a smooth experience across various screen sizes, from **desktops** to **mobile devices**.
